# Connectus-Pizza 

The objective of this project is to design a web application for pizza order delivery. The web application is a one stop portal for the restaurant. In our homepage, posters and restaurantâ€™s history are displayed. In our web application, users can choose to register and login to our portal for quicker booking process and membership rewards. Our application includes a page showing different food served and their details. Users can customize the food served and add them into their cart. By selecting the cart, users will be directed to our order page to view the full summary of the food added to the cart and the subtotal amount before proceed to payment. Our application also includes a page for users to redeem vouchers through membership points, unique code and deals offered by restaurant. Users can check their redeemed vouchers and add them into the order summary before checking out. Few payment methods will be provided for users to choose for user convenience. Once the payment is done successfully, an email notification including the booking details will be sent to the user. Our application also provides users order history checking feature.
